The license for php-yubico is the revised BSD license.

== Installation ==

Make sure your PHP installation supports curl, and that you have
installed PEAR.  On Debian/Ubuntu systems:

follows:

{{{
<?php
 require_once 'Auth/Yubico.php';
 $otp = "ccbbddeertkrctjkkcglfndnlihhnvekchkcctif";

 # Generate a new id+key from https://api.yubico.com/get-api-key/
 $yubi = new Auth_Yubico('42', 'FOOBAR=');
 $auth = $yubi->verify($otp);
 if (PEAR::isError($auth)) {
    print "<p>Authentication failed: " . $auth->getMessage();
    print "<p>Debug output from server: " . $yubi->getLastResponse();
 } else {
    print "<p>You are authenticated!";
 }
?>
}}}
